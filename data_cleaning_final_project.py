"""
Python script to format BackBlaze hard drive failure data for my final project in STAT 400.


Backblaze releases their data on a quarterly basis. In each quarter's folder of data, there
is a file for each day. Each day's worth of data has data from about 165,000 hard drives
with 149 columns for each row. Due to computational and time limits, we were not able to to 
use all of the data. Since our project was focusing on predicting failures, we decided to
select all failures found in a day along with a random sample of 200 data points from each 
day. The data points from each day was saved to a dataframe with the data from previous 
days. Once all files had been processed, the dataframe was saved to my STAT 400 folder as
a csv.

Data from Backblaze can be found here: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html
